        The third assignment required some debugging of provided JavaScript code. Once we debugged the code, the page should 
        end up giving users a quiz, on the amount of moons for three planets. There was maybe one thing I needed to fix on the HTML
        to make sure the quiz function actually executed. The JavaScript mostly worked after I checked around for missing brackets and whatnot,
        and making sure the code had "quiz_questions.length" made the page work for the most part. I also removed the num variable, since I don't think it was needed.
